## Repository Structure
Each folder corresponds to one Rosalind problem and includes:
- Source code for the solution
- Input file(s) provided by Rosalind (when applicable)


## Completed Problems (Bioinformatics Stronghold)
The following problems have been completed:

1. DNA – Counting DNA Nucleotides  
2. RNA – Transcribing DNA into RNA  
3. REVC – Complementing a Strand of DNA  
4. GC – Computing GC Content  
5. FIB – Rabbits and Recurrence Relations

## Implementation Notes
- Most solutions are implemented in **Python**.
- Code focuses on clarity, correctness, and direct mapping to biological concepts.
- No external libraries are required unless explicitly stated.

## Submission Note
This repository is submitted as part of the BioTuring recruitment process.  
All problems were solved independently.
